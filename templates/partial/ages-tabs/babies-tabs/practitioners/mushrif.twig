														<p>I am Joanie and I am a teacher at Odyssey Nursery. I know no single&#160; approach is the same with individuals so I have been researching a lot&#160; about why people act a certain way. This triggered my love for working&#160; with children to help them be independent. Personal development is a&#160; huge part of my life since I believe I'm never too old to learn. My passion is finding out what makes other people, especially children,&#160; tick and use that to help them grow and evolve their strengths. I have&#160; always been emotionally in tune with how other people feel around me&#160; thus I have found my passion lies in helping and giving.</p>
